# Machine-Learning-Notes
This repository is dedicated to maintaining my personal notes on different Machine Learning related topics, ranging from linear models to deep neural networks. 

Only the notes on (some) Linear Models are available for now, but they go in a lot of depth. More topics will follow soon.
